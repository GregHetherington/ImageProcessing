#### By: Greg Hetherington, Created on Feb 5, 2019

### About
This script will take in a 8-bit grayscale image and apply 3 different
contrast enhancement algorithms. The script will create 3 images(one
for each algorithm) and output them in the same directory as the input
image.

### Running the python Script

    python a1.py <Image File Path>

Example:

    python a1.py image1.png

### Notes:
* Images can be most file types (ie. PNG, JPG, TIFF, etc)
* Image must be 8-bit greyscale
* Libraries that must be updated:
    * numpy
    * PIL
    * imageIO
    * scipy.ndimage
    * pylab
    (pip can be used to update these)
